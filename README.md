# Predict-housing-price
Predict housing price through random forest and gradient boosting
For this project, we are going to use advance regression techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting to predict the predict the sales price for each house. 
For each Id in the test set, I will predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

The general steps are as following:

1. Data cleaning and outlier removal
2. Feature engineering and preprocessing categorical features with One-Hot Encoding
3. Perform Ordinary Least Square method to predict house price
4. Evaluate the prediction using MSE and R-square score
